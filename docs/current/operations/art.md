## Art pipeline

Tier F art never ships and never enters the repo; only the ledgers
(`art/SOURCES.tsv`, `art/plan.tsv`) and the tools are tracked.

```sh
python3 tools/art_fetch.py && python3 tools/art_process.py [--apply-picks art/picks.tsv]
python3 tools/art_coverage.py            # CI runs it WITHOUT --strict (empty bill on a runner)
python3 tools/art_hunt.py Furina ; python3 tools/art_contact_sheet.py --list
.venv/Scripts/python tools/cut_combat_layers.py klee [--check]
.venv/Scripts/python tools/gen_furina_stills.py    # and gen_kokomi_stills.py
.venv/Scripts/python tools/gen_char_icon_outlines.py [--check]   # all three outline halos
```

`art/plan.tsv` is UTF-8 + CRLF — read with `encoding="utf-8", newline=""` and
`rstrip("\r\n")`, or the last column silently stops matching. Depth:
`docs/current/art/` and `docs/current/atlas/tools.md`.
